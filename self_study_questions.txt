1. Explain the difference between RDBMS and SQL.

1an. RDBMS is relational database management system A relational database management system is a program that allows you to create, update, and
administer a relational database which is a structured set of data stored in a computer that allows us to identify and access data in relation 
to another piece of data. Most relational database management systems use the SQL language to access the database. SQL (Structured Query 
Language) is a programming language used to access the data in tables in a relational database management system



2. Why do tables need a primary key?

2an. Because it ensures row-level accessibility. If you choose an appropriate primary key, you can specify a primary key value, which lets you 
query each table row individually and modify each row without altering other rows in the same table. Also it can be used to allow accessibility 
or have a relationship to another table as a foreign key. 


3. What is the name given to a table column that references the primary key on another table?

3an. Foreign key.


4. What do we need in order to have a many to many relationship between two tables.

4an. Third table, called a join table that includes a match field that contains the value of the primary keys (in the form of foreign keys) 
of the two tables it joins.
